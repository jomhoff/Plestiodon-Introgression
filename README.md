# **UCEs and Introgression**

Hello!

This page is an outline of the methodology I used to take UCE data and make it more informative for studies of reticulation. In my workflow, I map UCEs to a chromosome-level reference genome, create 'psuedo-gene' partitions based on distance on each chromosome, and use multiple methods to quantify reticulation. 

Check out the workflow [here](https://github.com/jomhoff/UCEs-and-Introgression/blob/main/brevirostris-UCE.md)
